Why peach couriers limited?

The recent covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of the logistics industry and the role it plays in the delivery sector. At the peak of the pandemic, when cities were on lockdown, most households and businesses used the service to obtain basic and essential needs delivered at their door step, making it one of the fastest growing industries in the United Kingdom.
According to (Research FDI) It was reported that organisations such Amazon increased in profit to nearly 200%, equivalent to US$6 billion.(Amazon profits increased nearly 200% with covid-19, Research FDI, 2021)
The pandemic also showed the importance of having an online presence or social media networking, hence, businesses with no such link to the information super highway failed or struggled to cope with the rapid changes in the information technology world as compared  to their counterparts which flourished during the same period, a typical example is peach couriers limited, even though the company increased in revenue, its profit margin was nothing compared to its competitors who had some form of online presence, because it relied only on its existing clients without breaking any barriers.
Therefore, this website will provide information for prospective customers and businesses about the services peach couriers provide.
