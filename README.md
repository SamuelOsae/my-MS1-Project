Welcome to Peach Couriers Limited!

The aim of this project is to design and build a website for peach couriers limited to provide information only for its prospective clients.

Why peach couriers limited?

The recent covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of the logistics industry and the role it plays in the delivery sector. At the peak of the pandemic, when cities were on lockdown, most households and businesses used the service to obtain basic and essential needs delivered at their door step, making it one of the fastest growing industries in the United Kingdom.
According to (Research FDI) It was reported that organisations such Amazon increased in profit to nearly 200%, equivalent to US$6 billion.(Amazon profits increased nearly 200% with covid-19, Research FDI, 2021)
The pandemic also showed the importance of having an online presence or social media networking, hence, businesses with no such links to the information super highway failed or struggled to cope with the rapid changes in the information technology world as compared  to their counterparts which flourished during the same period, a typical example is peach couriers limited, even though the company increased in revenue, its profit margin was nothing compared to its competitors who had some form of online presence, because it relied only on its existing clients without breaking any barriers.
Therefore, this website will provide information for prospective customers and businesses about the services peach couriers provide.

First Time Visitors
. On opening the website, user are presented with the logo of the organisation and what they stand for but immediately, directed to the sliding carousel images which prompts them as why they are there in the first place, for delivery information.
. The images gives the visitor an idea of service they can be offered, from same day simple parcel delivery, next day multi drops or large goods delivery.

Returning Visitors

. Cost of delivery is also a deciding factor for most customers and will want to compare delivery prices from the price list

Limitations
I have included these limitations to highlight the things I should have done but could not do due to time constraints.
My journey through the course has been hampered by unbearable setbacks and the last straw which broke the camels back was twenty-four hours to my submission, I have lost my finished work as a result of a sudden shut down of my system.
I had to make two important decision, ask for time extension or redo the work again, I opted for the latter, hence, lack of time has limited and affected my intended outcome. Therefore, I will like future innovations of this website to include the following;

. A good and professional touch to the styling of the pages
. A formulae for calculating prices
. A sign up option
. A tracking system for customers to trace and track their deliveries in real time
. An option for collection, this website currently provides information for delivery only not collection
